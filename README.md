# Vaclav's "Colored Tiles" Flutter demo app

A demo Flutter app. Create tiles with random colors. As many as you want.

Originally inspired by https://medium.com/flutter/keys-what-are-they-good-for-13cb51742e7d but much more elaborate and using `ChangeNotifierProvider`.

This app gets improved as I'm learning more Flutter features ðŸ¤“

## Features
* horizontal scrolling 
* global buttons
    * add new tile
    * shift left/right
    * new colors for all tiles
* each tile has local controls
    * shown on hover (on desktop) or on tap (on mobile)
    * change color
    * remove
    * move left/right
* tooltips
